# Some TBJB Addons (sorry i put libraries)
These are just some addons for TBJB.
## Anti 67 (anti-67.js)
Replaces all instances of "67" with "The Number"
## Remove Hated (remove-hated.js)
Block someone using `/hate`, which makes the hated person not say anything to you, use `/unhate` to make a hated one unhated!
## Message Storage (message-storage.js)
Get the 5 most recent messages using `/recent`!
## Javascript On Trollbox (JOTrollbox/javascript-on-trollbox.js)
Use `/javascript` to run a javascript function.
# TRIVIA
1. Anti 67 breaks some URLs that contain 67
2. Remove Hated only uses names, not homes, so you can't use it to block someone indubitably forever.<br>
   2.1. This will be fixed.
